### Why the name MaidSafe?

Itâ€™s an acronym: Massive Array of Internet Disks, Secure Access For Everyone.

### Does MaidSafe require continuous Internet connection from all participants?

No, the network will rate each connection type and adjust for the resources it provides, in order to account for unavailability (through powering off or device failure). It's not a problem to be disconnected for shorter periods, however. If your node is unavailable for longer periods it will negatively impact on the service you receive from the network.

### What kind of research and validation has been carried out to affirm the the SAFE network will live up to the claims?

With such a radical solution, validation is extremely important. MaidSafe's technology has been peer reviewed with papers published and presented at the Wireless World Research Forum and the IEEE Computer Society. During development, MaidSafe has engaged with Scotland's leading technical Universities; Stirling, Strathclyde, St Andrews and the University of Abertay. Furthermore, MaidSafe's founder, David Irvine, has showcased the company's technology at the Google Scalability conference and at the British Computer Society's (Scotland) 50th Anniversary Christmas lecture.

Furthermore, a fully decentralised test network is now up and running, with 200 nodes spread across 3 continents.

### Who owns the SAFE network?

We all do! The SAFE network is an Open Source resource there for all users of the Internet. The network is completely anonymous, secure and aims to repel human intervention of any kind; it cannot be controlled or 'owned'. We feel very strongly about this and have written a [blog post](http://blog.maidsafe.net/2014/02/07/owning-the-network/) on the subject.
