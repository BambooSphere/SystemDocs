## Can ISP's thwart the SAFE network

The network uses encrypted [UDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) payloads to move data around the network. So UDP with unreadable content and hard to distinguish from regular Internet traffic. This will make it extremely difficult for ISP's to detect SAFE network traffic and therefore stop it. Furthermore, all nodes connect on different random ports, so port filtering (a way of controlling access) will not work.
