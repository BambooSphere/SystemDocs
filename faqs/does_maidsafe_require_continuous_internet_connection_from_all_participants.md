## Does MaidSafe require continuous Internet connection from all participants?

No, the network will rate each connection type and adjust for the resources it provides, in order to account for unavailability (through powering off or device failure). It's not a problem to be disconnected for shorter periods, however. If your node is unavailable for longer periods it will negatively impact on the service you receive from the network.
