# Projects on SAFE

These are project announced or under discussion on [maidsafe.org](https://www.maidsafe.org). Additional projects who contact MaidSafe direct may be placed here, we strongly encourage projects to announce to the community as opposed to direct to MaidSafe.

We work very hard to ensure this is a true community project and direct contact is acceptable, but private deals will not be done for any project that influences the core design. Everything has to be community knowledge and we find it works much better to enlist rather than use the community. We are proud members of that community and would strongly encourage others to do likewise.

Many projects will be private and released outwith the community and this is absolutely in line with the communities wishes.
