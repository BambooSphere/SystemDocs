# An End User

An End User is a participant on the network who utilises the client side software to use applications created by App Builders without providing any
of their computing resource to the network, making them distinct from Farmers. As the network requires safecoin for access, an End User will need
to acquire them from a decentralised exchange in order to use SAFE Network applications.

End Users may decide not to become Farmers as they have no additional resource to offer the network (they maybe running their own computer near
capacity), or they use a mobile device, such as a phone or a tablet, as their primary method of network access. While it is planned that mobile devices
will be able to earn safecoin, some manufacturers force disconnection of data after the screen has switched off, making them suboptimal farming
devices.
