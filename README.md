#What is MaidSafe?

Maidsafe is the company behind project SAFE. Project SAFE aims to replace the current centralised and controlled Internet infrastructure into a fully decentralised trustless network. The projects vision through the development of MaidSafe has been **Privacy, Security** and **Freedom** for all of the worlds population. It is thought these goals can be achieved with an Internet that is more inclusive and controlled by no individuals or companies.

MaidSafe is an open-source program that enables a decentralized internet platform, called the SAFE Network. MaidSafe autonomously handles static and dynamic data including communications. Data stored on the network is either encrypted and/or cryptographically signed by MaidSafe connected applications (clients). In either case the network itself cannot decrypt any of the data. MaidSafe also distributes all data on the network without the need for centralized servers. The idea was originally conceived by David Irvine who leads a small team building the base layer services. The system source code is open source and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/maidsafe).

#How does MaidSafe work?
The MaidSafe system turns all connected devices into SAFE Network nodes that collectively store data for all MaidSafe users. MaidSafe allows public and private cloud data storage and processing within the SAFE Network. Data storage is automatically decentralized. This means a web application, using MaidSafe does not store its user's data on any central server, rather the data is spread across many disks and devices owned and managed by many different users. No one person or corporation has an intact copy of a user's file. An overview short video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdGH40oUVDY)

#What is Safecoin?

Safecoin Is a coin that is generated and protected by the SAFE network and stays on the SAFE network (It of course can be copied as it is data, but off-network copies are of no value as a coin). Wallets will actually ask the network what their balance is and allow transactions to happen. The network can confirm and exchange coin ownership via a digitally signed authority from the coins last owner. This operation is ‘network atomic’ which basically means the network will make sure all copies update to show the transaction. This is a different approach to the ‘blockchain’ mechanism employed by bitcoin.

The SAFE network allows many millions of transactions per second and the larger the network the more transactions per second can be executed. Safecoin only holds the last and current owner. It does this to make sure the current owner has signed authority from the last owner to take ownership. This allows coins to be transferred between people very easily and without delay.  Safecoins use a proof of resource to create coins and this is a system that is waste free, so the proof is that a node or application is providing immediate value to society. This can be considered proof of validated resource provision.
