# How Is Safecoin Valued

While the number of users is increasing there is a virtuous circle: more and more Safecoin held in new wallets - because most users will be farmers by default - meaning that all users will tend to have at least a few Safecoin in their wallets until they cash out, at which point new Safecoin will slowly be redeposited through further farming. The ratio of Safecoin being saved (left in new wallets) versus the ratio being issued to farmers, will produce a value point.

So on the demand side for Safecoin, initially we have growth in new users (attracted by the massive free storage and other free apps) - even without services to buy, every new user is a potential farmer, who ends up with a few Safecoin lying in their wallet. The amount lying around in each wallet will tend to increase, as more services and apps that require Safecoin become available.

On the supply side, if the price goes up, farming becomes more lucrative, more people farm and more Safecoin is issued. This pushes the value down.

The volume of supply and demand both grow with the network, which tends to create an increasingly stable currency that grows in value over time. Value grows because it is linked to its usefulness (incentive to hold, which also increases over time), and the increasing number of users of the network (people wanting to hold it).

Over time the virtuous circle becomes stronger (volume increases) because the number of users is growing, and the incentive to hold Safecoin is growing due to the addition of premium apps and services, and later if adopted by merchants, for purchase of off-network goods and services.

Speculation will disrupt this of course, but there is a real value anchor here that helps dampen the impact of speculator trading.
