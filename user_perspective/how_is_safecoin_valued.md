# How Is Safecoin Valued

While the number of users is increasing there is a virtuous circle: more and more safecoin will be held in new wallets (most users will be farmers by default). This will increase liquidity and distribute wealth, providing almost all users with at least a few safecoin in their wallet. Users may wish to exchange their safecoin for network services, or for cash (or another digital currency) via an exchange.The ratio of Safecoin being saved (left in new wallets) versus the ratio being issued to farmers, will produce a value point.

The volume of supply and demand will grow with the network, which tends to create an increasingly stable currency that increases in value over time. Value grows because it is linked to its usefulness (incentive to hold, which also increases over time), and the increasing number of users of the network (people wanting to hold it).

Over time the virtuous circle becomes stronger (volume increases) because the number of users is growing. The incentive to hold and use safecoin will also increase due to the addition of premium apps and services. Speculation will disrupt this of course, but the network provides a real value anchor that will help to dampen this impact.
