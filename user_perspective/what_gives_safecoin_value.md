# What Gives Safecoin Value

[maidsafe.org](https://maidsafe.org/t/what-gives-safecoin-value-and-differentiates-it-from-altcoins/411)

Safecoin will be useful because:

people can use it to buy extra stuff (extra storage, premium services, premium apps)
people can earn it to pay for stuff
people can buy it from exchanges, set up to exchange it for fiat and vice versa
it will be attractive to people who need features bitcoin can't support (very high transaction rate, very low transaction latency)
it will be attractive to users compared to other coin (including bitcoin) because the wallet is simple and built in (just look how hard it still is to figure out which bitcoin wallets to use for what, and how to avoid losing your whole stash - with Safecoin this is handled with a single FAQ)
in time merchants will want to offer it because so many people have it and are used to purchasing with it
All these things give people are reason to value Safecoin, and if it is reasonably stable (or they need to hold some for usage), an incentive to hold some quantity of it rather than cash it all in.

This is completely different to Mastercoin (and almost every other altcoin) because they have little or negligable utility in themselves. No reason to value, no reason to hold.
