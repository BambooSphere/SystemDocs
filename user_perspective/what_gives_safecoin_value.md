# What Gives safecoin Value

Safecoin has value because it has utility. Users can earn safecoin by [farming](http://maidsafe.net/SystemDocs/user_perspective/farmers.html) safecoin and use it to buy more storage, and access premium applications and services on the network. It will also be possible to purchase safecoin via exchanges, as the network launches, and this will also provide safecoin with a direct fiat valuation.

The underlying network also provides safecoin with additional value in a less obvious way, via the transaction mechanism within the network (the SAFE networkâ€™s version of the block chain). Capable of processing millions of transactions per second and able to confirm transactions at network speed, the currency is instantly redeemable, secure and anonymous on wallets that are easy to use and built in to the network. These features are well suited to buying not only network services, but also products being sold on the network by merchants.
