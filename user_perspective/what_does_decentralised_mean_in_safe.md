# What does decentralised mean in SAFE

In project SAFE and in particular the MaidSafe approach is that decentralised means fully decentralised. This term is used extensively in the tech community, for the SAFE core network decentralised means:

1. No servers at all
2. No information from any server infrastructure (no DNS, no Time servers...etc...)
3. No connection to any server based networks
4. No centralised data structures across nodes
5. No controling party (or parties)
6. Zero control by humans for administration of data access
6. Fully inclusive (no ability to ban people or apply barriers to basic network access)
7. Borderless network; no borders or controls over network reach
