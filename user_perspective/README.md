# User Perspective

The MaidSafe network or more accuratly **SAFE network** is a platform that developers can build applications on. These application developers are referred to as builders on the SAFE network. A typical user application is demonstrated [here](blog.maidsafe.net/2014/04/21/safe-network-sample-app-features/).

This example shows an application that allows file storage/sharing and secure messaging. It does not show an important feature, the wallet. If using an application like the one shown (which is PC based) the user will notice a wallet. This wallet will contain a digital currency called safecoin. This safecoin balance will increase over time, which may surprise people.

It does not seem normal to download a free application and actually earn something at the same time. This may seem even more bizaar as people realise their privacy and security are not only protected, but enhanced in this system. Therefor there is no invasion of privacy or selling of anyones personal data for profit.
