# How and when can I farm safecoin

[maidsafe.org](https://maidsafe.org/t/how-and-when-can-i-farm-safecoin/419)

The estimated beta launch date is in Q4 2014. Our development [roadmap](https://github.com/maidsafe/MaidSafe/wiki/Roadmap) includes 3 test networks and our ability to launch on time is dependent on how well all 3 test nets perform. Unexpected issues could delay the launch.

Once we launch the SAFE Network, you will be able to download/install the MaidSafe program and connect to the network. Once you set up a Vault account, you can start farming, it is a very simple process.

As we get closer to this date, we will make a "Getting Started" guide or video to help people join easily.
