# How and when can I farm safecoin

The estimated Beta launch date is around late September 2014. Keep in mind it's dependent on how well all 3 testnets perform. Unexpected issues could delay the launch.

Once we launch the SAFE Network, you will be able to download/install the MaidSafe program and connect to the Network. Once you set up a Vault account, you can start farming.

As we get closer to this date, we will make a "Getting Started" Guide or Video to help people join easily.
