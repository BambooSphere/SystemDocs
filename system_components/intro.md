# System Components

This section describes the main system components. These are:

1. Self Encryption - A mechanism to obfuscate and encrypt data in a very secure fashion. This system presents a file-system API to the Drive library that is presented to users as virtual file-system. 
2. Autonomous network - A network to manage, store and manipulate all data and communications in a manner that requires no human intervention.
3. Self Authentication - A mechanism that allows people to create accounts on this network and login from any computer with SAFE applications installed.
